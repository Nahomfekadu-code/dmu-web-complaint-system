President: The highest authority in the system who can receive escalations directly from the handler and make final decisions on complaints. the escalation from president come from academic vice president or administrative vice president not from handler. the handler can assign the complain to president when the issue directly want the president. I am attach my project directories



the handler is coordinate the user and responsible body so, the handler assigns the complaint as want to responsible body. when the complaint is want responsibility of department head the handler assign to department head and the département head resolve it, send decision to handler. when the complaint cannot resolve by department head the department head escalate to college dean. when college dean resolves it , send decision to handler. When the complaint cannot resolve by college dean the college dean escalate to academic vice president. when academic vice president resolves it , send decision to handler. When the complaint cannot resolve by academic vice president the academic vice president escalate to president. when the complaint directly wants responsibility of college dean it will be   assign to college dean by handler when the college dean resolve send decision to handler   . When the complaint cannot resolve by college dean the college dean will escalate to academic vice president. The same flow to others
